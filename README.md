# Jeff.Ranks

If you are satisfied with the design and implementation of this project, I would be very much looking forward to the opportunity to discuss my thought process, design decisions, and code details with you in person.

## Project Structure

- **Jeff.Ranks** (It would be more appropriate to rename this to **Jeff.Ranks.Api**)  
  The main project, containing the core ranking service API implementation. It is the central module of the entire solution.

- **Jeff.Ranks.TestConsole**  
  A test console project used for quickly verifying and demonstrating the functionality of the ranking service.  

  > **Note before running**:  
  > Before starting `Jeff.Ranks.TestConsole`, please ensure that the `Jeff.Ranks` project has been successfully built and is running.  
  > Also, in the configuration file of `Jeff.Ranks.TestConsole` (typically `appsettings.json`), correctly set the `"host"` field to point to the actual domain or address of the `Jeff.Ranks` service (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
